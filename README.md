# blaster-wrapper
A repository containing the scripts for my game prototype, Blaster Wrapper.
This is a personal project of mine where I created just about everything, from the concept to the code to the artwork.
The game sees the player fending off waves of enemies in an old arcade-style game, where everything wraps around the screen.
In fact, some enemies can only be defeated by wrapping projectiles around the screen!

You can play the finished prototype on [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/prototype-build-1-1).
